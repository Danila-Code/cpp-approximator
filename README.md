# Approximator

## Description:
The Approximator allows you to describe a set of data pairs (x, y) using the functional dependence of y on x in the form of a polynomial dependence of a given degree. That is, the program approximates the data by a polynomial.

## Features:
The least squares method is used for approximation. The system of linear equations is solved by the Gauss method.
The result of the work is displayed as coefficients of a polynomial, and a graph in svg format.

### Using technologies:
C++, STL, SVG graphics, object-oriented programming.

### System requirements:
C++ 17, STL

## In the future I plan to add:
<br>a graphical interface
<br>the ability to interpolate data
<br>the ability generate code for the function y(x)
